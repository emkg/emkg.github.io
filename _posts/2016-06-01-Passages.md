  Below, inside the black outline, you can see one of my earliest web pages. The page I wrote to showcase the Passages project was meant to be a whimsical homage to the web I knew as a teenager, when things weren't so glossy. The Passages project was  meant to evoke a similar nostalgia, even if it also looked ahead to the future.
</p>

<p markdown="1">
  It is also worth noting how inspired I was by my Girls Who Code group. They made me see CSS more playfully than I had ever thought of it being. This site was an example for them to play with code.
</p>

<p markdown="1">
  Passages marked my full introduction to web development. This project was a true collaboration among artists, creativity, code, and conversation.

          In the Fall of 2015, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/allison-campbell-b89053120" target="_blank">Allison Campbell</a> approached me about collaborating with her on a <a href="https://github.com/passages/beta" target="_blank">project</a>. She wanted my help with either a data visualization display or with writing some code for an interactive piece for an art exhibit that would show in the Spring. I was excited to help, and we ended up working closely together from start to finish. Below, I've documented much of our process. Alli has more of the project documented on <a>her site</a> as well.

                      The themes we spent time with in the early stages of design revolved around personal identity in the context of technology. <br/><br/>
                      <em>If you interact, then you(r data) exists &#8211 </em> a phrase we came to in open discussion &#8211 inspired us to design an experience (described more below) involving an innocuous game and a provocative display involving user data.

                      We wanted a game that would lure users via nostalgia. The game would seem harmless, but would secretly harbor a camera that would take the users' pictures as soon as they opted to play. This would be technically with the user's consent (fine print) but without the users' explicit knowledge. We were playing with the haphazzard way we often interact with privacy and terms of use agreements.

                      In what would seem separate from the game experience, as if it were another piece in the show, we wanted to display user "profiles" where pictures of the game's players and their first names would appear in a slide show. Only users of the game itself would be able to understand the source for the profiles when they saw their own faces in candid poses in the profiles themselves.

                      <a>Laine Bergen</a> built us a cabinet of our design out of wood, cardboard, paper, and textile. We furnished the empty cabinet with a PC monitor hooked to a Raspberry Pi. Keyboard and mouse replace tradtional joystick and mouse.

                       We wrote a <a target="_blank" href="{{site.url}}/images/passages-img/story.pdf" style="text-decoration: none">story</a> with 4 different outcomes and created a series of webpages around the story. Again, an homage to text-based arcade games, the story was a choose-your-adventure. Each adventure choice was a live link to the appropriate page. <a> Steve Blesch</a> created art for us, which Allison colored and animated. Laine Bergen composed the <a href="#music">music</a>. The multimedia experience was retro, campy, and magical.

                      The profiles we displayed lacked some of the shock factor we had hoped for because our camera malfunctioned during the show. The message that our personal data may be used for purposes we may not have imagined or preferred for it was still accessible.

                       It turns out the most interesting part of the show was watching the players come and go. It would be fascinating to expand the project to involve user surveys and other covert surprizes to nudge the conversation further.

                      We quickly discovered that the camera placement on the cabinet did not take human factors into account. Images we captured in beta testing were often not of faces. We also failed to consider how many children would be drawn to the game. We did not wish to include images of children in our display for various reasons. When our camera malfunctioned during the show, we fixed it but chose to leave it off for ethical reasons. Future implementations would be designed to guarentee facial shots only and to factor children into the experience in an ethical manner.
