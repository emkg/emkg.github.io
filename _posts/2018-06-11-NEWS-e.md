When I was asked to help with this app, the previous version of it was throwing over 100 error messages per minute. If that sounds like a lot, it is. I believe 100 hours of content are uploaded to YouTube every minute--and that's a braggy stat; something they tell the shareholders. A hundred error messages per minute is basically a constant stream of noise in your error logs if you're a web server admin. This renders the error logs useless for all intents and purposes.

So my clients knew they needed help, and I offered to build them a React app that would not be able to read files on the server. This made my clients and my web server admin happy.

The design was provided to me. The app was to be used for a user study with weather scientists to evaluate their information consumption--how did they use the image products in terms of time spent on the images, how often did they visit certain types of images, and how did those products affect their ability to produce accurate 1-hour weather outlooks. My clients wanted the app to look *exactly* like the previous version. I had no sway on this.

The images are preloaded so there is no lag while viewing.

Menus are built using the portal feature in React. Due to a stacking context issue that is not uncommon with React apps, the menu appeared to be in front of its parent components, but were technically behind it. This left the menu items unclickable. The React portal feature allows the menus to be rendered outside the parent app div and positioned according to the rectangle coordinates of the appropriate menu button. The contents of the menu are send through the portal via props.

The images are stored with standardized file names. The app is not smart with respect to the server it lives on. The image urls are assembled in pieces based on the date, cycle, product, and unit selections. Swapping any of these pieces out changes the image product source.
